# Introduction
In 2017, an Australian property developer claimed that millennials were spending too much money on avocado toast instead of saving for their first home [@Millennials]. While the millennial avocado toast stereotype is by no means convincing, avocados are indeed a favored fruit in the U.S. According to a market report [@Market], the U.S. is the worldâ€™s biggest importer of avocados. As more health benefits about avocados are discovered and promoted, demand surged even more and so did the price. The goal of this project is to investigate whether we can reasonably predict the price of avocados based on past prices and geographical data.

A study [@Forecasting] investigated the various factors that might influence the avocado market. The researchers predicted that the avocado prices would likely decrease in the 2009-2010 season due to an increase in supplies and a probable decrease in demand caused by the financial crisis. Since the study was conducted over ten years ago, it seems be interesting to examine if the avocado market has changed over the years and if we can still predict the avocado prices given its supposed volatility in recent years.

## Data
The dataset used in this analysis is the publicly accessible Kaggle Avocado Prices dataset, which credited the Hass Avocado Board for the collection and release of the data. This dataset contains 13 variables encompassing the per-unit prices, total volumes, regions, and sizes of Hass avocados, a cultivar of avocados. Data from the start of 2015 to the end of the first quarter of 2018 are available. Each entry represents one observation from one region in the U.S. during one week. There are over 18,000 entries in total. Details of data encoding are provided in the appendix.

To enrich this dataset, we join it with the U.S. State Demographics dataset from the `choroplethr` package [@Choroplethr]. Selected demographic data include the total population in the region, the average percentage of white and black population, the average per capita income, and the average median age.

## Research Goals
#### Predicting the per-unit prices of Hass avocados
Specifically, we want to use the data from 2015 to the first quarter of 2017 to predict the avocado prices in the following year. Doing so allows us to compare the predicted prices with the recorded prices and evaluate the accuracy of the predictions. Predicting one year of avocado prices enables us to examine any seasonal variations in pricing.

#### Investigating whether spatial relationships exist
Does the region (where the observations were made) have any associations with the per-unit price of the avocados? If such spatial relationships are found, what might be some potential implications?

```

```{r fig.height = 2.5, fig.width = 4.5, fig.cap="Monthly Average Prices of Conventional Hass Avocados Over Time in the U.S.", eval=F}

<!-- From the plot above, we see the the per-unit price of the conventional Hass avocados increases every year from 2015 to 2018. Seasonal trends within each year also seem to exist, with lower prices in first two quarters and higher prices in the last two quarters. The plot of organic avocados shows very similar results. -->

df.total.conventional = df[(df$Region == 'TotalUS') & (df$Type == 'conventional'), ]
df.total.organic = df[(df$Region == 'TotalUS') & (df$Type == 'organic'), ]
```

avg_price_in_weeks <- ts(df.total.conventional$Average.Price, start = c(2015, 1), frequency = 52)

avg_price_in_weeks %>% decompose(type="multiplicative") %>%
  autoplot() + xlab("Year") +
  ggtitle("Prices of Conventional Avocados Show Seasonal Pattern")
```

The per-unit price of the conventional avocados increases yearly and exhibit seasonal trends. Prices peak in the third quarter and drop to the lowest in the first quarter. Organic avocados show very similar results.

  labs(title = 'Potential Inverse Relationship between Price and Total Volume',
       x = 'Total Number of Avocados Sold',

```

An inverse relationship seems to exist between the per-unit price and the total sales volume of the conventional avocados.

```

Regions with higher per capita income seem to have higher per-unit avocado prices. An exception is the Southeast region, which has the lowest per capita income but a relatively high per-unit avocado price. Further analysis is required to better explain this observation.


# Methodology
To predict the per-unit avocado prices from the first quarter of 2017 to the first quarter of 2018, we use a seasonal ARIMA with the total volume of avocados as the exogenous variable.

## Model Specification
Seasonal ARIMA $(p, d, q) \times (P, D, Q)_{s} = (1, 0, 0) \times (0, 1, 1)_{52}$ [@ARIMA_Formula]:
$$(1-\phi_1L)(1-L^{52})y_t=\delta + (1+\Theta_1L)w_t$$
$$y_t - y_{t-52} = \delta + w_t + \Theta_1 w_{t-52}$$
$$y_t = \delta + y_{t-52} + w_t + \Theta_1 w_{t-52}$$

The parameter $p$ is the number of time lags for the autoregressive (AR) model, $d$ is the degree of differencing, and $q$ is the order of the moving-average (MA) model. The uppercase $P, D, Q$ denote the autoregressive, differencing, and moving average terms for the seasonal part of the ARIMA model [@ARIMA_Notation]. The values of the parameters are determined using principles from the Boxâ€“Jenkins method [@ARIMA_Box_Jenkins].

```

The predicted per-unit prices for weeks 0-10 and weeks 35-48 are relatively close to the observed prices (differ by less than $0.1). The predicted prices for weeks 25-35 exhibit a similar pattern to the actual prices for weeks 20-30, i.e. the predictions seem to lag by roughly 5 weeks.

## Appendix

### Data Encoding Details
There are 54 unique regions in the dataset. One of these regions, denoted by `TotalUS`, encompasses the avocado volumes in the country as a whole. Another 8 regions corresponds to large geographical divisions of the U.S. such as the `Northeast` region, `Southwest` region, etc. The remaining regions represent smaller geographical areas in a less consistent way, sometimes referring to a single city in a state (e.g. `Chicago`) while other times denoting cities across states (e.g. `BaltimoreWashington`). Some regions can also be ambiguous - cities such as `Albany` and `Jacksonville` can be found in more than one state. Thus, to manage the location data consistently and unambiguously, we choose to focus on the 8 geographical regions.
